# Exercises from Functional Programmming in Scala
The red book has exercises which, at least trying, I make on my own.
You can compare them with github project[FP in Scala](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala)

The ["red book"](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) is really nice to learn Functional Programming.
